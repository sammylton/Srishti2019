Working in a team of 5, we assembled a DIY drone using Ardupilot and achieved the gesture control drone using open source hardware and software platforms.
Gestures were sent by a NodeMCU 1.0 ESP-12E to a Rpi3 and then to a PX4 to control the motor speeds.
We modifed the prevalent codes for MPU6050, Wi-Fi, etc. to get the final code.
The drone was checked by RC on Mission planner and Q-ground control.
