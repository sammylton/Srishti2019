# Srishti2019
Came up with the model of a Gesture drone controlled by hand gestures and 3D printed the STL files.
Hand gestures registered on "MPU6050 GY-521" 3-axis Gyro Accelerometer Sensor Module were sent by a "NodeMCU 1.0 ESP-12E" Wi-Fi module to an "Rpi3" and then to a "PX4" flight controller on the drone to control the speed of propeller motors.
Merged the prevalent open-source codes for MPU6050, Wi-Fi, etc. to get the final code all well with compatibilty.
The flight was first checked by Remote Control on Mission planner and Q-ground control open-source software platforms.
Received the Certificate of Participation for exhibiting Gesture Drone in Artificial Intelligence and Electronics Section during Srishti 2019 organised by Studentsâ€™ Technical Council, IITR.
